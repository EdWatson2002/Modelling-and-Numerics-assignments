# Modelling-and-Numerics-assignments
Assignments I produced for the Differential Equations: Modelling and Numerics module. Unfortunately I cannot share the questions I am actually answering in these assignments for copyright reasons, but I believe this demonstrates my abilities well enough without it.

The focus of these assignments are on implementing and assessing the efficiency of various Runge-Kutta methods for approximating solutions to second order differential equations.

Assignment 1 focusses on the Forward Euler Method

Assignment 2 focusses on comparing the efficiency and accuracy of various methods, mainly the Forward Euler, Backward Euler, Crank-Nicholson and Semi-implicit Euler methods

Assignment 3 focussed on
